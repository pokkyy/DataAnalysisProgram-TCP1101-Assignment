> TCP1101 Programming Fundamentals Assignment | Trimester 1 2021/2022


The Data Analysis Program is a program thatâ€™s able to perform statistical analysis on any given file and output the results in the form of a report of a HTML report.

The statistical analysis includes finding the minimum, the maximum, the median, the mean, the variance, the standard deviation, the correlation between any two selected columns, the distinct data members, and plot a histogram.

The program is built upon 4 main functions which are the user registration and authentication, the data file reader, the statistical computation, and the menu system. By combining these 4 functions, the program is built upon a solid foundation that can operate in the most efficient and smoothest way possible. Added with its user-friendly interactive interface, this program is able to guide the user through its system with as little chance of failure as possible. If a failure were to occur, the program can detect them and deal with them accordingly.

The reports and HTML reports produced by the program enlightens the user with the statistical analysis in an easy to comprehend manner. These reports are designed to display the statistical computation information in its utmost clarity.
